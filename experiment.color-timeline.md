- [ ] Write explanation for the experiment @wrdwllm
- [ ] Output full timeline as a SVG graphic @wrdwllm
- [ ] Output full table as a CSV file @wrdwllm
- [ ] Include groups of colours with representative sentences as tables @wrdwllm
- [ ] Draft examples/images from list of ideas @wrdwllm
- [ ] Embed GIFS of screen captures for examples that are not fully interactive @wrdwllm

#### Ideas for examples/images

- Multiple levels of magnification
  - Outline of three books
  - Zoom in on a chapter/section with interesting/diverse colors
    - Provide explanation and context for chapter
  - Zoom in on paragraph-length examples with examples of words
- Pair named colors with sentence examples from the book (show variation in black, gray, yellow, green, etc.)
  - Also include information from dictionaries about word origin, age, history, etc.
- Explain named color data source


- [ ] Produce CSV file with options to filter by chapter
- [ ] Reformat ggplot2 graph
  - [ ] Output one graph for each book


### Context

- [[Place|relationship.place]] is a poorly defined concept
- Physical phenomena (such as light and color) contribute 
- See also: 
  - [[Taxonomy of nonhuman place|relationship.place#Taxonomy-of-nonhuman-place:#*]]


#### Objectives

- Provide a tool/tools for exploring the use of color in *Gormenghast*
  - Produce tables depicting frequency of color words (nouns and adjectives) and their position in the novel ("novel time")
    - Provide a measure of relatedness between color words and other key terms in the novel
  - Produce graphs that visualise this information

#### Agents

- Clients
  - Readers of the novel can use the timeline as a tool to supplement deep reading and exploration of the novel.
  - Designers and artists can use the tool to support creative (re-)interpretations of the novel.
- Actors
  - [[The author|example.experiment.gormenghast]] and his unique set of experiences, biases, stylistic flourishes, etc.

#### Medium

1. The full text of the novel (unstructured text).
2. External sources, databases and techniques (lists of colors from thesauri, specialist databases, natural language processing libraries, etc.).
3. Images, graphs and tables that [[(re-)interpret the novel (item 1) using information from item 2|experiment.place-schema]].

### Methods

![[experiment.text-analysis]]


### Results

- State results here, include some images

### Discussion

- Future uses by exhibition visitors, e.g. toolkit
  - Topics for further research using this tool/logic from this tool/lessons, etc.
  - Support creative action (designing, art) vs. scientific knowledge (replication)
