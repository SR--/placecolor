Use this note to gather and compare various relevant takes on subjectivity and also perception.

Consider embedding examples inline, including:

- Visual perceptions

- Etc.

Highlight key ideas:

- Perception is subjective
- All life has it
- there is huge overlap between perceptions across individuals and species
- There is much more to perception than is commonly expected, cf. 35 human senses
- There is always bias, oppression, epistemological violence, ontological violence
