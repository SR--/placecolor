- [ ] Find specific examples 

- An observer's perception of an environment contributes to their sense of a place.
- Cultural and biological factors influence these perceptions
  - A bird species may instinctively fear a shape resembling a predator, or covet a certain color.
  - First Nations people may avoid a place they consider sacred based on a shared oral and/or written history.
- Species possessing sentience, language and culture generate complex narratives about places that can vary between members of the same cultural group. 
    

## Significance

- What motivated our inquiry?
  - Desire to extract subjective descriptions of place from text (e.g., adjectives, place names) and parse them to identify patterns and trends (e.g., common associations between nouns and descriptive words)
  - Use descriptive
- Who could this research benefit?
- How does it relate to the [[broader themes|relationship]]?
  - Differences in perceptual abilities and how these influence culture, understanding of place, etc.

## Research Gap

- Challenges and limitations of quantifying subjective text 
  - Statistical analysis of subjective descriptions is difficult.
    - Why? 
  - Current methods for quantifying interpretations of places (e.g., journal entries, online reviews, social media posts) capture few descriptive place terms. 
    - These methods produce binary or hierarchical interpretations of a place, e.g. what adjectives visitors use to describe a Google Maps location.[REF]
    - Large datasets exist to support analysis, but these are intended for commercial applications (e.g., market research, improving search engine results).
    
- Ambiguity of place as a concept

## Opportunity

Opportunity to investigate tools from:
- Digital humanities and natural language processing
  - Digital humanities scholars use natural language processing and statistcal analysis to quantify literary texts. These approaches identify trends in word usage (number of times a word is used, common word pairs, etc.) in a single text (e.g., *Moby Dick* by Herman Melville) or across large corpora (e.g., the works of Jane Austen or all Gothic novels published during the 19<sup>th</sup> century).
    - Sentiment analysis uses lexicons to 'measure' the sentiment of words.  The process determines the 'sentiment' of a text (e.g., a sentence or paragraph) by assigning each word to a lexicon category. 
      - The [NRC Emotion Lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) is an open-source lexicon for sentiment analysis that can score words based on sentiments (positive or negative) and eight emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, etc...).[^c]
- Geographical information (imagination) systems
  - Speculative research (c.f. 'geographic imagination systems') demonstrates applications of these methods.[^a] [^b]

### Limitations

- Accessible (open-source, suitable for personal computers) software can perform categorisation based on word frequency (how many 'positive' words appear in this sentence?) but struggles with complex language tasks (detecting sarcasm, negation, qualifications), which can reduce accuracy. 
    - The influence of errors decreases as corpus size increases. Trends observed in the works of Jane Austen are more reliable than one paragraph from *Pride and Prejudice*.a
