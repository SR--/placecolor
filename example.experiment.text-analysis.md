### Context

Standard introduction for any tasks involving text analysis of *[[Gormenghast|example.gormenghast]]*.

#### Objectives

- Provide tools and methods for "quantifying" the use of language related to [[place|relationship.place]] in *Gormenghast* with a focus on the relationships between:
  1. Phenomena such as [[color|relationship.color]], light, texture and atmosphere.
  2. Discrete geographical locations and their component parts, e.g. buildings and rooms, forests and trees, etc.
- Explore and discuss issues relevant to [[place|relationship.place]], [[design|relationship.design]] and [[communication|relationship.communication]] that emerge from attempts to create these tools, particularly those that emphasize the differences in [[subjectivity|relationship.subjectivity]] between species.
- Describe the difficulties inherent in attempting to "quantify" subjective phenomena such as atmosphere, mood and events from unstructured text.
  - Ambiguous/loosely-defined cultural phenomena such as [[place|relationship.place]] are amalgamations of different sources not limited to the impression created directly by language, e.g. collective/cultural memory such as awareness of other works, history, symbolic associations play a large part.


#### Agents

- Directly involved
  - Readers of the novel can use the timeline as a tool to supplement deep reading and exploration of the novel.
  - Designers and artists can use the tool to support creative (re-)interpretations of the novel.
- Implicitly invoked
  - [[The author|example.experiment.gormenghast]] and his unique set of experiences, biases, stylistic flourishes, etc.

#### Medium

  1. The full text of the novel (unstructured text).
  2. External sources, databases and techniques (lists of colors from thesauri, specialist databases, natural language processing libraries, etc.).
  3. Images, graphs and tables that [[(re-)interpret the novel (item 1) using information from item 2|example.experiment.place-schema]].

### Methods

- Select a test corpus
  - Why did we select this novel?

### Results

* See [[example.experiment]] for the outcomes of our attempts to apply the above logic to several "phenomena" in the novel.
