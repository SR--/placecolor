- [ ] Collect examples of interesting words and categories from Historical Thesaurus
- [ ] Format using tables and embed in Markdown
- [ ] Visualize categories using graphs and/or diagrams

### Overview

### Context

- Human languages have developed over thousands of years
- They reflect cultural norms, biases and traditions
  - See [[relationship.color.language]]
- Such biases include the ways that humans think about nonhumans as 'others'
- Exposing and exploring these biases is useful for thinking about nonhuman [[subjectivity#relationship.subjectivity]].
  - See [[relationship.color.perception.bee]] for a similar approach using computer software to simulate the color vision of bees.

#### Objectives

- Demonstrate biases in human language and attempts to classify language, e.g. thesauruses, ontologies, databases.
- Present a curated selection of interesting words related to human and nonhuman place
- Suggest ways of 'exposing' bias in texts by classifying using HTOED categories
  - Indicate potential for future work

#### Agents
