Lindsay and Brown, "Within-language diversity in color naming. (A) Diversity in 110 WCS languages. Each pie chart represents one WCS language (numbers at the top) […] (B) Examples of WCS data from four languages; language numbers from A. The top two rows are the two K = 6 branches of the GBP (Green|Blue|Purple) motif; the second two rows are the two K = 5 branches of the Grue motif, both of which are united as single motifs at K = 4." 2009.

Basic color terms and color universals

> Colour semantic studies of individual languages are often greatly concerned, some would say obsessed, with the matter of basicness. Which colour words are Basic Colour Terms (BCTs) and which are not? As with other basic vocabulary, BCTs are frequently used, in both speech and writing, and they are well known to all adult speakers of the language. English speakers all know words such as mother, arm, red and green but they are less likely to encounter and/or understand sibling, pancreas, burgundy and taupe, which suggests that the second word-set contains non-basic terms.[^2]

Absence of color universals in other languages

> the article presents a detailed study of the visual world reflected in the Australian language Warlpiri and in Warlpiri ways of speaking, showing that while Warlpiri people have no ‘colour-talk’ (and no colour-practices’), they have a rich visual discourse of other kinds, linked with their own cultural practices.[^3]
