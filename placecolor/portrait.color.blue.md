>A sea of dark dunes, sculpted by the wind into long lines, surrounds Mars' northern polar cap and covers an area as big as Texas. In this false-color image, areas with cooler temperatures are recorded in bluer tints, while warmer features are depicted in yellows and oranges.

## Natural History of Blue


## Cultural History of Blue

## Blue in Human Language
>“‘Dat zijn maar blauwe bloempjes’ - ‘Those are nothing but blue flowers.’ In which case ‘blue flowers’ means a pack of bald-faced lies.” - Maggie Nelson, Bluets. 45

The way humans see colour is dependent on their language. Without the words to describe matter reflecting certain spectrums of light waves, we might be aware of the quality of “blue” but not yet have a word to describe it. Throughout a plethora of human cultures studied by philologist Lazarus Geiger this similar pattern in colour words as descriptors of place seemed to be absent, especially when concerning blue.


### Types of Blue

- By place
- By language
- By use
- By origin, emphasise the colors borrowed from plants and animals. As species disappear, will the colors lose reference? Do the contemporary tables of colors replace the role of named colors?
- Etc.

In naming colors, human imagination refers to things: materials, pigments, stones, animals, flowers, sky...

- azury: Blue, bluish, tinted with soft clear blue. 1600
- lazuline: Of the colour of lapis lazuli. 1877
- violaceous: Of a violet colour; purplish blue. 1657
- perse: Of a dark blue, bluish-grey, or (esp. in later use) purplish black colour. 1425
- pavonaceous: Of the blue-green colour of a peacock's breast. 1688
- cerulean: Of the colour of the cloudless sky, pure deep blue, azure. 1677 And cerulescent: Tending to cerulean. 1880
- livid: Of a bluish- or purplish-grey colour. a1425

Butterflies

[Why Do Butterflies Have Such Vibrant Colors and Patterns?](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/150307-butterflies-caterpillars-colors-predators-prey-animals-science)

Reasons for their color:

- Hiding From Predators
- Sending a Warning
- Attracting a Mate
- Keeping Warm

Consider nonhuman aesthetic reasons such as sexual selection... Link to evo-devo. Link to geographic co-evolution and therefore place. Link to evolutionary innovation.
