* Image caption should follow Chicago 17A style. 
* Use inline HTML for styling because Markdown does not have a native image caption block.
* Can apply custom style later by targeting `<figcaption>` tags.

<figcaption>
Last name First name. Title of Work. Date of creation or completion. Medium. Name of Institution. Location (if applicable). <a href="">URL</a>.
</figcaption>
