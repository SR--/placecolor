This note describes how we imagine other researchers and developers could use and extend our workflow.
## Benefit to other researchers
  - We hope that other researchers can use this research project as a template.
  - We believe these applications could serve humanities researchers exploring concepts without specific outcomes.
    - Features such as Dendron's [[Note Graph|https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/587e6d62-3c5b-49b0-aedc-02f62f0448e6/]] reveal links between notes that researchers might miss.

## Contribution to open-source software
  - The developers for [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) create their applications for note-taking. They may lack awareness of unusual use cases such as ours.
  - Our project demonstrates that this use case can benefit other research communities. A concise summary of our project's goals can support discussion with developers, who may be unfamiliar with humanities research. 
    - The open-source model encourages interaction between users and software developers. Developers adjust their software in response to feedback. 
    - Open-source software invites users to contribute to its development, although this requires technical knowledge.

## General ethos
  - Changes are accessible to everyone.
  - Approved collaborators can contribute.
  - Anyone can fork the project and propose changes.
  - History facilitates learning (generative conflict/agonism).
  - Website reflects changes to internal documents, allowing observers to follow our progress and become involved.
## Workflow
  - GitHub means change history is tracked and accessible to anyone.
    - Contributors can resolve change conflicts together.
  - GitHub Issues enables users to debate changes.
  - [New Relic CodeStream](https://www.codestream.com/) allows users to comment on documents and see GitHub issues in context.

## Similar projects

- [Digital gardening](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
  - [History of the concept by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
  - Loosely organised/hierarchical collections of notes that serve as knowledge bases for users.
## Limitations
- Visual Studio Code and git/GitHub can challenge inexperienced users. 
  - Instructions that simplify this procedure could smooth this learning curve, allowing users to contribute quickly.
