## Notes

### Smart Spaces

- [Mediated Atmospheres](https://www.media.mit.edu/posts/mediated-atmosphere/)
  - Extending research into use of atmosphere (lighting, air conditioning, other environmental parameters) beyond concerns about productivity  at the office, e.g. health, mood, satisfaction, nonhuman issues, etc.
