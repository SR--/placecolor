- [ ] Add examples of unusual senses (delusions, normal perception, c.f. Oliver Sachs)

Color is one of the senses. But what are senses?

- There are no senses, individual senses are a convenience invented for the purposes of description
- There are sensory devices such as eyes and ears but they do not work in isolation
- Perception is always multisensory
- There are many more sensors that humans commonly think: about 30 and not 5

A common definition of a sense in neurology is a group of sensory cells that responds to a physical phenomenon, also corresponding to a  region of the brain interprets the signals. Neurologists define abilities such as the sense of direction as post-sensory cognitive activities.

>Recently, psychologists and neuroscientists have provided a great deal of evidence showing that perceptual experiences are mostly multimodal. As perceivers, we don’t usually recognize them as such. We think of the experiences we are having as either visual, or auditory or tactile, not realising that they often arise from the fusion of different sensory inputs.

* Sight or vision
* Hearing or audition
* Smell or olfaction
* Taste or gustation
* Touch or tactition
* Thermoception - the sense of heat (there is some debate that the sense of cold may be a separate sense)
* Nociception - the perception of pain
* Equilibrioception - the perception of balance
* Proprioception - the perception of body awareness (close your eyes and touch your nose. Got it first time? That's proprioception in action)

[Senses special: Doors of perception](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18524841-600-senses-special-doors-of-perception/)

Cohen's eco-psychological senses (53) come in four groups:

- The radiation senses: sense of colour, sense of moods associated with colour, sense of temperature.
- The feeling senses: sensitivity to gravity, air and wind pressure, and motion.
- The chemical senses: hormonal sense, such as pheromones, hunger for food, water or air.
- The mental senses: pain, external and internal, mental or spiritual distress, sense of self, including friendship, companionship and power, psychic capacity.
