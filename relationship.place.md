## Definition

Place is a spatial/physical matrix that limits the formation of patterns but also as a cultural product that underlies group learning, behavior, and ecosystems.

- Place as a concept is difficult to define.[^1]
- It has emerged from several different epistemologies.[^2]

- Sense of place is formed through the interaction of memory (written or oral history, patterns of behavior, instinct, etc.) with the physical world
- Formation of sense of place depends on the subjectivity of agents and their perceptual and cognitive capabilities (capacity to perceive and reflect upon the physical world)
  - The cognitive capabilities of agents also dictate their ability to construct and interpret complex physical artefacts that enrich a sense of place

### Taxonomy of nonhuman place

- [ ] Review and revise @SR--

- The physical world
  - Perceptual capabilities, e.g. [[ability to perceive color|relationship.color.perception]]
    - Agents with varying degrees of agency (complexity)
      - Landscape, e.g. forests, mountains
      - Lifeforms, e.g. [[humans|portrait.character.taxon.human]], [[bees|portrait.character.taxon.bee]], [[mosses|portrait.character.taxon.moss]], amoeba, trees
      - Phenomena, e.g. [[color|relationship.color]], light
      - Natural forces, e.g. wind, tornadoes, waves
- The mental world
  - Cognitive capabilities, e.g. memory, language, writing
    - Events
      - Experienced
        - Learned/instinctive behaviors, e.g. prey avoiding locations where they experience predators or animals recognizing areas rich in fruit
        - Learned cultural practices, e.g. rituals or repeated behaviors performed and taught by both humans and nonhumans
      - Recorded
        - Written histories
        - Oral histories
        - Physical artefacts, e.g. cave paintings, rock formations, art

## Place and Living Beings

Is it necessary for a living being to experience a place for it to be a place?

Even if it is necessary, there is a wide variety in which living beings can engage with places, where those places are, how long they persist, etc.
