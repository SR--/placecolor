## What is Color?

> Color is a function of the human visual system, and is not an intrinsic property. Objects don't have a color, they give off light that appears to be a color.[^1]

- The spectrum of colours visible to humans is defined by the range of wavelengths from 380–740mm.
  - **See also**: [[relationship.color.physics]]

## Why Should We Think about Color?

- A critical issue for interspecies cohabitation and [[design|relationship.design]] is facilitating an understanding of different subjectivities between stakeholders where communication using language is impossible.
- Color lies at the intersection of many of the issues relevant to interspecies cohabitation, namely [[communication|relationship.communication]] and [[subjectivity|relationship.subjectivity]].

To illustrate:

- Color is:
  - **Perception**: "A function of the human visual system."[^2]
    - The [[ability to perceive certain wavelengths as visual information|relationship.color.perception]] is determined by the evolution of biological systems.  
  - **Physics**: A term referring to a [[range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum|relationship.color.physics]].
  - **Language** [[A group of words referring to specific colors|relationship.color.language]].

## Understanding of Color in History

[[relationship.color.perception]]

Colours are “no more than mere names so far as the object in which we place them is concerned … they reside only in consciousness. Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be wiped away and annihilated”, Galileo, 1623, The Assayer

>By night, The Moon appears brighter by night than by day. without all comparison. And methinks the Moon resembleth that pillar of Clouds and pillar of Fire, which guided the Israelites; which at the presence of the Sun, appeared like a Cloud, but in the night was very glorious. Thus I have by day observed the Moon amidst certain small Clouds, The Moon beheld in the day time, is like to a little cloud. just as if one of them had been coloured white, but by night it shines with much splendor.

>So that if you had never happened to see the Moon, save onely in the day time, you would not have thought it more shining than one of those Clouds."
