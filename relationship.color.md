## What is Color?

> Color is a function of the human visual system, and is not an intrinsic property. Objects don't have a color, they give off light that appears to be a color.[^1]

* The spectrum of colours visible to humans is defined by the range of wavelengths from 380–740mm.
  * **See also**: [[relationship.color.physics]]

## Why Should We Think about Color?

* A critical issue for interspecies cohabitation and [[design|relationship.design]] is facilitating an understanding of different subjectivities between stakeholders where communication using language is impossible.
* Color lies at the intersection of many of the issues relevant to interspecies cohabitation, namely [[communication|relationship.communication]] and [[subjectivity|relationship.subjectivity]].


To illustrate:

* Color is:
  * **Perception**: "A function of the human visual system."[^2]
    * The [[ability to perceive certain wavelengths as visual information|relationship.color.perception]] is determined by the evolution of biological systems.  
  * **Physics**: A term referring to a [[range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum|relationship.color.physics]].
  * **Language** [[A group of words referring to specific colors|relationship.color.language]].
