## What is Color?

> Color is a function of the human visual system, and is not an intrinsic property. Objects don't have a color, they give off light that appears to be a color.[^1]

The spectrum of colours visible to humans is defined by the range of wavelengths from 380–740mm.

## Why Should We Think about Color?

[ ] Discuss and expand from notes

* Color lies at the intersection of many of the issues relevant to interspecies cohabitation, namely [[relationship.communication]] and [[relationship.subjectivity]].

To illustrate:

* Color is:
  * "A function of the human visual system."[^2]
  * A term referring to a [[range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum|relationship.color.physics]]
