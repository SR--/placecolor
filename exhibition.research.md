## Significance
- [ ] Describe the difference between the Place and Parametricism objectives and this exhibition's objectives

Provide the larger-level questions
## Gap

## Opportunity

## Research Questions and Outcomes

What roles do tools play in the perception, communication, memory and use of colour (place colour, situated colour, etc.)?

## Hypothesis

## Objectives

1. Articulate complex relationships in physics, biology, culture, and design that human scholarship does not fully understand. Provide a way to discuss complex and contested issues where important research results exists but are not conclusive.
2. Link scholarship from multiple domains of knowledge and practice.
3. Present the outcomes in the form that overcomes the constraints of journal and book publishing with their limitations on the numbers of images or alternative and parallel narratives.
4. Encourage visitors to experience the content as an experiment that they have to perform with the aim of expanding their knowledge but also their ethical, cultural and practical imagination.
5. Curate for constructive and productive engagement with content supported by speculative design experiments and the need to constructively engage with what is given, like a game, with support and some rules.

## Notes

- [ ] Integrate the notes below into the text proper

Suggestions for Awnili

Consider the link to knowledge. What is different now? What ought to be different (hint, more-than-human knowledge)
How is knowledge different in connection to globalisation, to technology?
Consider the link to culture (artworlds/business), have exhibitions became entertainment business?
From here, consider the ethical/moral reasons for them, are they worth making?

Bodies of knowledge:

Digital archiving
Digitization
Software development, agile, open, transparent approaches

Manovich

Provocative questions:

Does the concept of an exhibition still make sense? What is the intellectual history?
Are exhibitions still useful, intellectually or ethically?

Strong/weak sides to them
The observation that something has been common in the past or is still common does not necessarily mean it is a good/worthwhile way to do things

* Useful/parallel/interesting concepts
  * [Digital gardening](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
    * Loosely organised/hierarchical collections of notes that serve as knowledge bases for users.
    * [History of the concept by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

* Future ideas
  * Integration of reference objects (e.g. Zotero) into knowledge bases
  * More meaningful integration of notes with node graph, so nodes
