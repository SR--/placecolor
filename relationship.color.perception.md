Subjective experiences of color vary between humans and will likely vary between other animals, individuals and species. Old and young can see differently, males and females (in some species males have dichromatic but females can have trichromatic vision), neurologically different individuals across species.

These relationships become further complicated because different species use different portions of the spectrum to see the same place and add other senses.
