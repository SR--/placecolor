![Color timeline](/assets/images/color-frequencies.png)

- [ ] Write explanation for the experiment
- [ ] Output full timeline as a SVG graphic
- [ ] Output full table as a CSV file
- [ ] Include groups of colours with representative sentences as tables

### Context

- [[Place|relationship.place]] is a poorly defined concept
- Physical phenomena (such as light and color) contribute 
- See also: 
  - [[Taxonomy of nonhuman place|relationship.place#Taxonomy-of-nonhuman-place:#*]]
  - 

#### Objectives

- Provide a tool/tools for exploring the use of color in *Gormenghast*
  - Produce tables depicting frequency of color words (nouns and adjectives) and their position in the novel ("novel time")
    - Provide a measure of relatedness between color words and other key terms in the novel
  - Produce graphs that visualise this information

#### Agents

- Clients
  - Readers of the novel can use the timeline as a tool to supplement deep reading and exploration of the novel.
  - Designers and artists can use the tool to support creative (re-)interpretations of the novel.
- Actors
  - [[The author|example.experiment.gormenghast]] and his unique set of experiences, biases, stylistic flourishes, etc.

#### Medium

1. The full text of the novel (unstructured text).
2. External sources, databases and techniques (lists of colors from thesauri, specialist databases, natural language processing libraries, etc.).
3. Images, graphs and tables that [[(re-)interpret the novel (item 1) using information from item 2|example.experiment.place-schema]].
