<ul>
<li>Symposium in August to discuss links between projects</li>
<li>How will Dendron and Miro interact?
<ul>
<li>Suggested that Miro could serve as a visual representation of specific characters and stories from Dendron but should not duplicate entire research database.</li>
<li>Miro is useful as a tool for interactive/synchronous collaboration with peers (c.f. spatial software), e.g. discussing/working on a project live or engaging with an exhibit with other audience members.</li>
</ul>

<li>Speak to Stephen Liu and Gini about possible machine learning applications</li>
