<p>Vision (or the eye) has evolved multiple times in the Earth's evolutionary history.</p>
<p>For example, see Peter Godfrey-Smith on an alternative evolutionary pathway of an octopus eye. Last common ancestor with humans is a flat worm or some such creature (cf. <a href="/placecolor/notes/0wFEYhsz7eIhQTZ5fUCnQ">Planarian</a>). Yet, octopi have good vision that has developed independently.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact about octopi is that they most likely can see light, and possibly patterns of light, with their whole skin.</p>

<p>Hence the questions: what is vision?</p>
