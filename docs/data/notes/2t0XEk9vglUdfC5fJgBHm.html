<p>This exhibition is about place and color.</p>
<p>Why should you be interested in place?</p>
<p>Why should you be interested in color?</p>
<p>What are color and place?</p>
<p>How are they related?</p>

<ul>
<li>Acute crisis</li>
<li>Acute oppression of nonhuman lifeforms, organised exploitation and disregard to wellbeing, needs, capabilities, etc.</li>
<li>It is impossible to understand places without close engagement with subjectivities of multiple agents, interspecies relationships, traditions, cultures, communities</li>
<li>They can be hidden and counterintuitive, humans have hard-to-avoid biases: time, scale, similarity, etc.</li>
<li>It is useful to slow down and pay close attention or study scientifically but this is not enough</li>
<li>It is also necessary to structure the environment to give the oppressed political powers that correspond and express their capabilities, based on human understanding and their own actions/resistance</li>

<ol>
<li>Articulate complex relationships in physics, biology, culture, and design that human scholarship does not fully understand. Provide a way to discuss complex and contested issues where important research results exists but are not conclusive.</li>
<li>Link scholarship from multiple domains of knowledge and practice.</li>
<li>Present the outcomes in the form that overcomes the constraints of journal and book publishing with their limitations on the numbers of images or alternative and parallel narratives.</li>
<li>Encourage visitors to experience the content as an experiment that they have to perform with the aim of expanding their knowledge but also their ethical, cultural and practical imagination.</li>
<li>Curate for constructive and productive engagement with content supported by speculative design experiments and the need to constructively engage with what is given, like a game, with support and some rules.</li>

<ul class="contains-task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" disabled> Integrate the notes below into the text proper</li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions for Awnili</p>
<p>Consider the link to knowledge. What is different now? What ought to be different (hint, more-than-human knowledge)
How is knowledge different in connection to globalisation, to technology?
Consider the link to culture (artworlds/business), have exhibitions became entertainment business?
From here, consider the ethical/moral reasons for them, are they worth making?</p>
<p>Bodies of knowledge:</p>
<p>Digital archiving
Digitization
Software development, agile, open, transparent approaches</p>
<p>Manovich</p>
<p>Provocative questions:</p>
<p>Does the concept of an exhibition still make sense? What is the intellectual history?
Are exhibitions still useful, intellectually or ethically?</p>
<p>Strong/weak sides to them
The observation that something has been common in the past or is still common does not necessarily mean it is a good/worthwhile way to do things</p>

<p>Future ideas</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration of reference objects (e.g. Zotero) into knowledge bases</li>
<li>More meaningful integration of notes with node graph, so nodes</li>
