Bioluminescence is one of the most important means of communication in nature.

75% of ocean animals can make their own light, most of animals are marine, this amounts to many trillions of fish. 

Ocean covers most of the planet's surface, most of it is very poorly explored. It clearly is a very important place with very different topographies, colours, etc.
