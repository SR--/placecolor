## Objective

Body of evidence, examples, questions and ideas that make the notion of place inclusive of all forms of life.

## Declarations

All lives have places
All lives have subjectivity

## Exhibition Synopsis

This exhibition is about place and color.

Why should you be interested in place?

Why should you be interested in color?

What are color and place?

How are they related?

## Why Is It Important to Think about Place and Senses?

- Acute crisis
- Acute oppression of nonhuman lifeforms, organised exploitation and disregard to wellbeing, needs, capabilities, etc.
- It is impossible to understand places without close engagement with subjectivities of multiple agents, interspecies relationships, traditions, cultures, communities
- They can be hidden and counterintuitive, humans have hard-to-avoid biases: time, scale, similarity, etc.
- It is useful to slow down and pay close attention or study scientifically but this is not enough
- It is also necessary to structure the environment to give the oppressed political powers that correspond and express their capabilities, based on human understanding and their own actions/resistance

## Significance
- [ ] Describe the difference between the Place and Parametricism objectives and this exhibition's objectives

Provide the larger-level questions
## Gap

## Opportunity

## Research Questions and Outcomes

What roles do tools play in the perception, communication, memory and use of colour (place colour, situated colour, etc.)?

## Hypothesis

## Objectives

1. Articulate complex relationships in physics, biology, culture, and design that human scholarship does not fully understand. Provide a way to discuss complex and contested issues where important research results exists but are not conclusive.
2. Link scholarship from multiple domains of knowledge and practice.
3. Present the outcomes in the form that overcomes the constraints of journal and book publishing with their limitations on the numbers of images or alternative and parallel narratives.
4. Encourage visitors to experience the content as an experiment that they have to perform with the aim of expanding their knowledge but also their ethical, cultural and practical imagination.
5. Curate for constructive and productive engagement with content supported by speculative design experiments and the need to constructively engage with what is given, like a game, with support and some rules.

## Notes

- [ ] Integrate the notes below into the text proper

Suggestions for Awnili

Consider the link to knowledge. What is different now? What ought to be different (hint, more-than-human knowledge)
How is knowledge different in connection to globalisation, to technology?
Consider the link to culture (artworlds/business), have exhibitions became entertainment business?
From here, consider the ethical/moral reasons for them, are they worth making?

Bodies of knowledge:

Digital archiving
Digitization
Software development, agile, open, transparent approaches

Manovich

Provocative questions:

Does the concept of an exhibition still make sense? What is the intellectual history?
Are exhibitions still useful, intellectually or ethically?

Strong/weak sides to them
The observation that something has been common in the past or is still common does not necessarily mean it is a good/worthwhile way to do things

- Useful/parallel/interesting concepts
  - [Digital gardening](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)
    - Loosely organised/hierarchical collections of notes that serve as knowledge bases for users.
    - [History of the concept by Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

- Future ideas
  - Integration of reference objects (e.g. Zotero) into knowledge bases
  - More meaningful integration of notes with node graph, so nodes
