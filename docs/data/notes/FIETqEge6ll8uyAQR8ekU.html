<p>Sexual selection drives the emergence of color in living organisms.</p>
<p><img src="/placecolor/assets/images/2021-06-24-20-17-44.png"></p>
<p>We can generalise to say that sexual selection. This means females follows their cultural preferences, of fashion, to select increasingly strange ornaments, including color.</p>

<p>The colors and shapes of the flowers are a precise record of what bees find attractive.... It would be a paradoxically anthropocentric mistake to assume that, because bees are more primitive organisms ... there is nothing in common between our pleasure in flowers and theirs.<a id="fnref-1" class="fnref" href="#fn-1">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
