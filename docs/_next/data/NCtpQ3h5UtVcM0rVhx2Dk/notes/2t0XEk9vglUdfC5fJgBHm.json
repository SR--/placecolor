organised exploitation and disregard to wellbeing, needs, capabilities, etc.</li>\n<li>It is impossible to understand places without close engagement with subjectivities of multiple agents, interspecies relationships, traditions, cultures, communities</li>\n<li>They can be hidden and counterintuitive, humans have hard-to-avoid biases: time, scale, similarity, etc.</li>\n<li>It is useful to slow down and pay close attention or study scientifically but this is not enough</li>\n<li>It is also necessary to structure the environment to give the oppressed political powers that correspond and express their capabilities, based on human understanding and their own actions/resistance</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Wadiwel, Dinesh Joseph. “Do Fish Resist?” <em>Cultural Studies
