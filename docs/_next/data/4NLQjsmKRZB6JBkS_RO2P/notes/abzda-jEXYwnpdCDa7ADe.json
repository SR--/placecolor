The leaves and the moss were cold with the dew. Working forwards on his elbows, he found his way almost completely barred by a tough network of boughs; but the edge of his eagerness to break his way through was whetted, for a branch had swung back and switched him across his cheek, and in the pain of the moment he fought the muscled branches, until the upper part of his body had forced a gap which he kept from re-closing with his aching shoulders. His arms were forward of his body and he was able to free his face of the leaves, and, as he panted to regain his breath, to see ahead of him, spreading into the clear distances, the forest floor like a sea of golden moss. From its heaving expanses, arose, as through the chimera of a daydream, a phantasmic gathering of ancient oaks. Like dappled gods they stood, each in his own preserve, the wide glades of moss flowing between them in swathes of gold and green and away into the clear, dwindling distances.<a id=\"fnref-1\" class=\"fnref\" href=\"#fn-1\">1</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/placecolor/notes/os5dIoOBteAREv4lGwyzA\">Moss</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"backlinks\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#backlinks\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Backlinks</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/placecolor/notes/DGuctHcDOTFbZtytqe-Rw\">Place</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"footnotes\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#footnotes\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Footnotes</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span id=\"fn-1\" style=\"display: none;\"></span><p>Peake, Mervyn. <em>The Illustrated Gormenghast Trilogy: Titus Groan.
