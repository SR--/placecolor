>The quality or attribute by virtue of which something appears to have a colour, so that it may present different appearances to the observer regardless of shape, size, and texture; the sensation corresponding to this, now recognized as dependent on the wavelengths of the light reaching the eye. 1398 (OED)

Colour is only important because humans privilege visual perception, which is unusual among many terrestrial animals who stay closer to the ground and rely more on olfaction.
