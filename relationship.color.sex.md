We can generalise to say that sexual selection. This means females follows their cultural preferences, of fashion, to select increasingly strange ornaments, including color.

>The colors and shapes of the flowers are a precise record of what bees find attractive.... It would be a paradoxically anthropocentric mistake to assume that, because bees are more primitive organisms ... there is nothing in common between our pleasure in flowers and theirs.[^1]

The umbrella relationship to this is that of pleasure, something all animals and, really, all life is capable of.
