## Why Is It Important to Think about Place and Senses?

- Acute crisis
- Acute oppression of nonhuman lifeforms, organised exploitation and disregard to wellbeing, needs, capabilities, etc.
- It is impossible to understand places without close engagement with subjectivities of multiple agents, interspecies relationships, traditions, cultures, communities
- They can be hidden and counterintuitive, humans have hard-to-avoid biases: time, scale, similarity, etc.
- It is useful to slow down and pay close attention or study scientifically but this is not enough
- It is also necessary to structure the environment to give the oppressed political powers that correspond and express their capabilities, based on human understanding and their own actions/resistance
