### Place & Colour Update 30/06/2021

- Symposium in August to discuss links between projects
- How will Dendron and Miro interact?
  - Suggested that Miro could serve as a visual representation of specific characters and stories from Dendron but should not duplicate entire research database.
  - Miro is useful as a tool for interactive/synchronous collaboration with peers (c.f. spatial software), e.g. discussing/working on a project live or engaging with an exhibit with other audience members.
- Speak to Stephen Liu and Gini about possible machine learning applications
