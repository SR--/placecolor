There is a direct evolutionary link between fitness and reflectance.

In a mechanism that relates to place, there is an evolutionary link to irradiance through the evolution of microhabitat choice. Further, emerging evidence suggests that terrestrial habitats (places) have distinct irradiance signatures that can influence the evolution and distribution of colours and patterns in communities and ecosystems.[^1]
